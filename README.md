Easy financial portfolio selection.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U portsel
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add portsel
```

Then you can run

```bash
portsel --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run portsel --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/thomasbtf/portsel/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/thomasbtf/portsel/tree/master/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
</details>

## Very first steps

### Poetry

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc
</p>
</details>

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

## üéØ What's next

Well, that's up to you üí™üèª. I can only recommend the packages and articles that helped me.

- [`Typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) is great for creating CLI applications.
- [`Rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) makes it easy to add beautiful formatting in the terminal.
- [`Pydantic`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/) ‚Äì data validation and settings management using Python type hinting.
- [`Loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) makes logging (stupidly) simple.
- [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) ‚Äì fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI.
- [`IceCream`](https://github.com/gruns/icecream) is a little library for sweet and creamy debugging.
- [`orjson`](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) ‚Äì ultra fast JSON parsing library.
- [`Returns`](https://github.com/dry-python/returns) makes you function's output meaningful, typed, and safe!
- [`Hydra`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) is a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications.
- [`FastAPI`](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) is a type-driven asynchronous web framework.

## üöÄ Features

### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/thomasbtf/portsel/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/thomasbtf/portsel/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
